              Your primary hyperstable account is actually a <strong className="text-foreground">Smart Contract Wallet</strong> deployed on the Base blockchain (an Ethereum Layer 2 network). We use industry-leading <strong className="text-foreground">Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe)</strong> technology for these wallets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike traditional wallets controlled by a single private key, Safes are smart contracts. This offers enhanced security and flexibility:

                <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Self-Custody:</span> You, and only you, control the funds in your Safe via your login method (e.g., email, social login managed by Privy). hyperstable cannot access or move your funds.

              <li>
                <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Programmable Security:</span> Safes enable features like multi-signature requirements (requiring multiple approvals for transactions - a planned future feature for hyperstable teams) and spending limits.

                <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Account Recovery Options:</span> Smart contract wallets can offer more robust recovery mechanisms than traditional wallets (details depend on configuration).

              We partner with <a href="https://privy.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">Privy</a> to manage user authentication and wallet interactions securely. When you log in (e.g., with email), Privy generates a secure key specific to your browser session.
            </p>
            <p>
              This session key is then used to interact with your <strong className="text-foreground">Privy Smart Wallet</strong>. This smart wallet acts as the <strong className="text-foreground">owner</strong> of your Safe account vault. This means actions you take in hyperstable (like approving a withdrawal) are authorized by your login session via Privy, which then directs your Safe to perform the action.
            </p>
             <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
               Think of it like this: Your login method controls the Privy Smart Wallet, and the Privy Smart Wallet controls your main hyperstable Safe account vault.

            <p>
              Performing actions on a blockchain (like deploying your Safe or sending funds) requires paying a small &quot;gas&quot; fee to the network validators in the network&apos;s native currency (ETH on Base).
            </p>
            <p>
               To simplify onboarding, hyperstable (via Privy) <strong className="text-foreground">sponsors</strong> the gas fees for certain initial actions, like deploying your Safe account vault. This means you don&apos;t need to have ETH initially to get set up.
            </p>
            <p>
               However, for actions initiated later, like withdrawing funds from your hyperstable account to an external address, <strong className="text-foreground">you will be responsible for the gas fees</strong>. These are typically small but necessary for the blockchain transaction to be processed.

              For invoices created within hyperstable, we utilize the <a href="https://request.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">Request Network protocol</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you create an invoice, the details are stored both in our database and registered on Request Network. This creates a verifiable, on-chain record of the payment request, linked to your account address. It allows for decentralized tracking of invoice statuses (e.g., paid, pending) based on blockchain events.

              Your secure account vault (Safe) and transactions primarily operate on the <a href="https://base.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">Base network</a>.

              Base is an <strong className="text-foreground">Ethereum Layer 2 (L2)</strong> network developed by Coinbase. It offers significantly lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times compared to the main Ethereum network (Layer 1) while still benefiting from Ethereum&apos;s security.
