# CreateSafe Refactoring Verification Checklist

## Core Functionality Verification

### ✅ Smart Wallet Detection & Creation
- [x] Checks for existing Privy smart wallet on load
- [x] Creates new smart wallet if none exists  
- [x] Polls for smart wallet creation completion
- [x] Handles smart wallet creation errors
- [x] Shows appropriate UI states during creation

### ✅ Safe Deployment
- [x] Uses Privy smart wallet as Safe owner
- [x] Creates Safe with threshold of 1
- [x] Uses deterministic salt nonce for address generation
- [x] Sends deployment transaction via smart wallet client
- [x] Waits for Safe deployment confirmation
- [x] Retrieves transaction hash from EntryPoint logs

### ✅ Primary Safe Detection
- [x] Checks for existing primary safe on component mount
- [x] Shows "Account Created" state if safe already exists
- [x] Prevents duplicate safe creation

### ✅ Profile Updates
- [x] Saves deployed Safe address via `completeOnboardingMutation`
- [x] Updates user profile with primary safe address

### ✅ UI States
- [x] Loading state while checking account status
- [x] Smart wallet creation step with progress messages
- [x] Safe activation step with progress messages
- [x] Success state with deployed address display
- [x] Error states for both smart wallet and safe creation
- [x] Copy address functionality with visual feedback

### ✅ Navigation
- [x] Handles next step navigation (via props)
- [x] Falls back to dashboard if no next step
- [x] Skip functionality (via props)

### ✅ Helper Functions
- [x] `waitUntilDeployed` - polls for bytecode existence
- [x] `waitForUserOp` - retrieves tx hash from logs
- [x] `copyToClipboard` - copies address with feedback

### ✅ Error Handling
- [x] Smart wallet creation rejection
- [x] Safe deployment failures
- [x] Profile save errors
- [x] Network/RPC errors

## Differences Between Original and Refactored

### Removed (Unused)
- `useSendTransaction` hook - not used
- `createWalletClient` - not used  
- `ArrowLeft`, `ChevronRight` icons - not used
- `Progress` component - not used

### Added (Improvements)
- Props interface for reusability
- `onSuccess` callback for parent components
- `onSkip` callback for custom skip handling
- Configurable navigation via props
- Optional skip button display

## Integration Points

### AllocationSummaryCard Usage
- No props needed for basic display
- Safe creation works standalone
- User can create safe without leaving dashboard

### CreateSafePage Usage  
- Passes skip functionality
- Passes navigation context
- Maintains original page behavior

## Conclusion

All critical functionality has been preserved. The refactoring:
1. Extracted all logic into a reusable component
2. Made it more flexible with props
3. Maintained 100% of the original functionality
4. Added improvements for reusability
5. No breaking changes to existing flows
