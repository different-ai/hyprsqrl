# Improved Transaction Display

## What Was Done

### Backend Improvements (safe-router.ts)
1. **Enhanced Transaction Type Detection**:
   - Better detection of incoming vs outgoing transactions
   - Improved token transfer identification using `dataDecoded.method`
   - Extract token info from transfers array when available
   - Pass safe address to properly identify incoming transfers

2. **Added Transfer Data**:
   - Include transfers array in the TransactionItem interface
   - Extract token info from MULTISIG_TRANSACTION transfers
   - Better handling of both txHash and transactionHash fields

### Frontend Improvements (transaction-history-list.tsx)
1. **Better Transaction Titles**:
   - Shows "Sent USDC" or "Received USDC" for token transfers
   - Shows "Sent ETH" or "Received ETH" for native transfers
   - Proper method name formatting for module executions
   - Handles common DeFi operations (swap, deposit, withdraw, redeem, approve)

2. **Improved Descriptions**:
   - Shows token amounts with proper symbol
   - Shows sender/receiver addresses (truncated)
   - Shows ETH amounts for native transfers
   - Shows contract address for generic module executions

3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**:
   - Dynamic icons based on transaction type and method
   - Color coding: green for incoming, blue for outgoing, orange for withdrawals, purple for swaps
   - Appropriate icons for different operations

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### 1. Better Data Decoding
- The Safe Transaction Service provides a `dataDecoded` field that contains method parameters
- Need to parse these parameters to extract recipient addresses for token transfers
- Example: For `transfer(address,uint256)`, extract the recipient from parameters[0]

### 2. Enhanced Token Information
- Fetch and cache token metadata (logo, full name) for better display
- Handle missing token info gracefully
- Support for NFT transfers (ERC721/ERC1155)

### 3. Transaction Categorization
- Group transactions by type (DeFi, NFT, Governance, etc.)
- Identify common protocols (Uniswap, Aave, etc.) for better labeling
- Show protocol logos when available

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Implement WebSocket connection for real-time transaction updates
- Show pending transactions
- Update transaction status in real-time

### 5. Advanced Features
- Transaction search and filtering
- Export transaction history
- Show gas costs and fees
- Calculate and display USD values
- Transaction receipts and detailed views

## Implementation Notes

The current implementation relies on the Safe Transaction Service API which provides:
- `type`: ETHEREUM_TRANSACTION, MODULE_TRANSACTION, or MULTISIG_TRANSACTION
- `dataDecoded`: Contains method name and parameters
- `transfers`: Array of token transfers within the transaction
- `tokenInfo`: Token metadata when available

To further improve, we should:
1. Parse `dataDecoded.parameters` to extract recipient addresses
2. Use a token metadata service for logos and additional info
3. Implement a protocol detection system based on contract addresses
4. Add transaction caching for better performance
