# Transaction History Improvements

## Overview
Replaced the mock transaction data with real blockchain transaction fetching from the Safe Transaction Service API.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Real Blockchain Data
- Fetches actual transactions from the user's Safe wallet using the Safe Transaction Service API
- Uses tRPC endpoint `safe.getTransactions` which connects to `https://safe-transaction-base.safe.global/api`

### 2. Transaction Type Detection
The system now properly identifies different transaction types:
- **Incoming**: Transactions where the Safe receives tokens
- **Outgoing**: Transactions where the Safe sends tokens
- **Module Execution**: Smart contract interactions (transfer, redeem, withdraw, etc.)
- **Creation**: Safe wallet creation transaction

### 3. Visual Improvements
- Each transaction type has its own icon:
  - Incoming: ArrowDownLeft (green)
  - Outgoing: ArrowUpRight (blue)
  - Module: Code icon (purple)
  - Creation: Plus icon (gray)
- Clean, modern UI matching the design system

### 4. Transaction Details
- Shows transaction method names for module executions
- Displays token amounts with proper decimal formatting
- Shows sender/receiver addresses (truncated)
- Relative time display (e.g., "2 hours ago", "Yesterday at 3:45 PM")

### 5. External Links
- Each transaction links to Basescan explorer
- "View all on Basescan" button links to the Safe address page

### 6. Loading & Error States
- Proper loading spinner while fetching data
- Error messages if transaction fetching fails
- Empty state when no transactions found
- Message when no Safe is connected

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified
1. `packages/web/src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/(bank)/components/dashboard/transaction-history-list.tsx`
   - Complete rewrite to fetch real data
   - Added transaction type detection logic
   - Improved UI with proper icons and colors

2. `packages/web/src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/(bank)/page.tsx`
   - Updated import path to use the improved component

3. `packages/web/src/server/routers/safe-router.ts` (Additional improvements)
   - Enhanced transaction parsing to better identify token transfers
   - Extract token info from transfers array
   - Improved type detection for incoming/outgoing/module transactions

### Dependencies
- Uses existing tRPC router (`safe.getTransactions`)
- Leverages `viem` for address and unit formatting
- Uses `date-fns` for time formatting
- Integrates with existing `useUserSafes` hook

## Additional Improvements (Latest)

### Enhanced Token Transfer Display
1. **Better Transaction Titles**:
   - Now shows "Sent USDC" or "Received USDC" instead of generic "Module Execution"
   - Properly identifies ETH transfers as "Sent ETH" or "Received ETH"
   - Shows meaningful names for DeFi operations (Swap, Deposit, Withdraw, etc.)

2. **Improved Backend Parsing**:
   - Extracts token information from the transfers array in the API response
   - Better detection of transaction direction (incoming vs outgoing)
   - Handles both ERC20 token transfers and native ETH transfers

3. **Dynamic Visual Elements**:
   - Icons change based on transaction type and method
   - Color coding is more intuitive (green for deposits, orange for withdrawals)
   - Better handling of unknown or complex transactions

## Future Enhancements
1. Add transaction value in USD
2. Show gas fees
3. Add filtering by transaction type
4. Implement pagination for viewing more transactions
5. Add real-time updates via WebSocket
6. Show pending transactions
7. Add transaction categorization (DeFi, NFT, etc.)
8. Parse dataDecoded parameters for more detailed recipient info
9. Add protocol detection for common DeFi protocols
10. Implement transaction search functionality
